This article is all you need to understand the importance of observability,
why we need it, it's history, current standards (Open Telemetry) and a brief
overview of how it all fits together. This is for people who are starting
their journey into **Observability**.

## What is Observability

To fully understand **observability** and it's importance, let's try to
understand things step by step, starting from understanding "system".

**System** is a collective term, given to the combination of everything
you have to manage and handle while running your applications. It
includes the infrastructure, networking, business logic, Production/
Dev/QA environment etc. This is where you applications run, and your
customers access them.

**Observable** refers to a system's ability to expose its internal state in a way
that allows engineers to understand and troubleshoot it effectively. A system
is observable when all the crucial information about it's working, which
includes the following, but not limited to:

- Memory Usage.
- Error Rates.
- CPU Consumption.
- Active Users.
- Request Latency.
- Application logs.
- A user request's route inside the system.

are exposed, collected, processed and made sense of.

In the context of **Observability**, this crucial information is called **Telemetry
Data**.

While a system being observable means that it exposes _Telemetry Data_,
**Observability** is the _broader_ practice of **collecting**, **analyzing**, and
**using** this data to gain deep insights into system behavior.

### Where the Telemetry data comes from

The telemetry data comes from the applications and the infrastructure running our
systems. Your application must be properly **Instrumented**, i.e. there should
be written logic, that makes sure telemetry data is properly **collected**,
**structured** and **exported** from the system.

Observability goes beyond just monitoring predefined telemetry data. It enables
engineers to ask any question about the systemâ€™s state. Even those they did not
anticipate when designing it. This flexibility is especially critical in complex,
distributed architectures like **microservices** and **cloud-native** applications,
where unexpected issues arise frequently.

### Brief history of Observability

Initially there were no **Global Standards** for instrumenting systems to process
telemetry data. As systems grew in complexity, different teams and organisations
implemented their own observability solutions. Focusing on different telemetry data
depending on their in-house needs. This lead to:

- **Inconsistencies**: Different teams used different strategies, formats, tools,
  making it hard to **correlate telemetry data**.
- **Fragmentation** : Different type of telemetry data lived in separate silos, requiring
  multiple tools to get a full picture of the system.
- **Lack of Knowledge transfer** : Since there was no standardization, one organisation's
  works could not be directly carried over to the other, leading to **re-inventing
  the wheel** again and again.

## Open Telemetry

To solve these issues, the industry moved towards a standardized approach, leading
to the creation of [OpenTelemetry (OTel)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/what-is-opentelemetry/).
OpenTelemetry provides a common framework
for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data.

It standardized three major sections in a **vendor neutral** way:

1. **API, SDK and Data**:

- Defining what the data would look like (structure of telemetry data, what
  properties they would have etc. making sure they are serializable. **Data**),
- How they can be correlated (how to connect one type of data with other i.e. **API**).
- How different languages implement the above standard specifications (**SDK**).

They divided the telemetry data in three major sections and collectively called
them **Signals**:

- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements like CPU usage, request latency, and error
  rates.
- **Traces**: End-to-end tracking of a request as it flows through multiple services.
- **Logs**: Timestamped records of system events, errors, and debugging information.

2. **Instrumentation**: Provided two standard ways to instrument a system:

- [Zero-code](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/): The libraries you use to
  build your application have instrumentation logic in them.
- **Code-based**: OTel provides [APIs and SDKs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/)
  for most languages,
  which can be used to instrument your code, this can be used to
  cover any use-case that might not be implemented by the Zero-code way.

3. [Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/): A single, standard,
   vendor-agnostic place (binary) to **receive**, **process** and **export** the
   telemetry data. This collector is _configurable_ and can fit all of your
   system's needs.

Using the above standards, the telemetry data can be collected in a standard way,
so any tool, that uses OTel standards, can use that data to draw
insights, **This is where [SigNoz](https://signoz.io) shines**.

## Collector

> Collector is not a requirement with OTel, the telemetry signals can directly be
> sent to a **backend**, [read this to know more](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/deployment/no-collector/).

It is the most crucial part of the OTel framework. It is a binary, that is configurable
using a `YAML` file, through which we can modify every aspect of a **telemetry data
pipeline** i.e. from collecting the data, processing it and all the way to exporting
it to a backend of your choice (signoz, prometheus, etc.).

It provides a lot of features out of the box, which includes but not limited to:

- **Configurable**: Combinations of different ways to collect, process and export
  signals.
- **Performant**: Stability and Performance under varying loads and configurations
  (community has optimised the implementation).
- **Extensible**: Customizable without touching the business logic code.
- **Unified**: A single piece of code (collector binary), deployable in different
  **platforms** (Kubernetes, Virtual Machines etc.) and **patterns** (Agent, Deployment
  etc.)

In the next article, we will try to understand the working of the **Open Telemetry
Collector**. That will help us better understand observability and how to make
our own systems observable.
