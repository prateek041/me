## Anatomy of an eBPF program

When working with eBPF programs, there are a few parts to it, namely:

- When the program will run.
- What it will do.
- How will it share information with the user space.

### When the program will run

As mentioned in our previous article
[Introduction to eBPF](https://prateek-singh.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-ebpf#heading-programs-in-kernel-space)
, eBPF programs run by attaching them to various types of kernel events, when
those events are triggered, eBPF code attached to them is also run.

The one which we will be using in this article are `KProbes` (Kernel probes),
which are hooks in the kernel program.

#### Brief introduction to KProbes

Since Kernel is also a piece of software that is written in a programming language,
comprised of individual functions and logic which are run depending on what action
is to be performed.

Probes allow you to attach a custom logic (eBPF program) to a specific kernel
function (let‚Äôs say A). When the kernel executes the function A, `KProbe` intercepts
it and executes the custom eBPF code, when that returns, the kernel continues the
execution of the function A as if nothing happened.

### What it will do

The capabilities of the program depends on what kernel event it is attached to,
some of the very simple use-cases can be:

- An eBPF program attached to a network socket can inspect each packet and decide
  whether to drop or forward it, enabling fine-grained firewall logic or custom
  filtering based on content, IP, or protocol.
- Attach eBPF to a system call (e.g., `open()`) and log whenever a file is opened.
  This can help track file access patterns.
- An eBPF program attached to TCP events can measure the time it takes to send and
  receive packets, helping to identify latency bottlenecks.
- Attach eBPF to file I/O events to inspect read/write actions, allowing specific
  access control to sensitive files.

And many more use-cases which we will progressively build and test in the future.

### How will it share the information with the user space

#### Why to share the information

As mentioned in
[Introduction to eBPF](https://prateek-singh.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-ebpf#heading-programs-in-kernel-space)
, most of the applications we interact with run in the user space, so if we have
eBPF programs performing some actions in the kernel space, the user may want to
know what they are doing.

It can be simple information like:

- How many times a user interacted with files in the system.
- How many packets were dropped and why were they dropped.
- How much time was taken by each packet to be sent or received.

And everyone loves beautiful Dashboards to look at instead of numbers and plain text.
Programs for such dashboards run in User space, they are written in high level
programming languages like JavaScript. These dashboards read data from a **store**
and render them in beautiful UI/UX.

#### How to share the information

There are countless ways of storing information and we will talk about them
extensively. They are **Data Structures** which include but are not limited to:

- **BPF maps:** Depending on the use-case and the type of data you want to store,
  there are different types of BPF maps available. Some of them are listed here
  [uapi/linux/bpf.h](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.15.86/source/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h#L878)
  and they range from arrays, Key value pairs and so on.
- **Ring Buffers:** These are more flexible data structures that allow you to
  write different size/type of data and are efficient with how they store information.
  We will talk extensively about them later.

Now we understand the three building blocks of an eBPF program, so let‚Äôs write
our first program.

## First Program

```python
from bcc import BPF

program = r"""
int hello(void *ctx) {
    bpf_trace_printk("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
"""

b = BPF(text=program)
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")

b.trace_print()
```

Above we have our **‚ÄúHello world‚Äù** equivalent of an eBPF program. It has two major
parts.

- The eBPF program that will run in the kernel which is the string stored in
  variable `program`.
- The user space code (python) that will load the eBPF program into the kernel
  and read out the information generated.

Let‚Äôs understand the program line by line.

```python
from bcc import BPF
```

[BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) is a Python framework that provides us with
various utility functions to write and run eBPF programs. It provides utilities
for IO, networking or monitoring related programs.

```python
program = r"""
int hello(void *ctx) {
    bpf_trace_printk("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
"""
```

`program` is a python variable that stores a string, which is our eBPF program itself,
this is the program that is loaded in the kernel and runs.

The program is a C function named `hello` which does nothing special, it uses a
utility function from `BCC` named `bpf_trace_printk()` which takes the argument
passed to it and writes them in a pseudo file location: `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`.

In our case, we are writing `Hello world` into the file.

```python
b = BPF(text=program)
```

`BPF` is a utility function that will take our eBPF program (stored in `program`
as a string) and compile it before it gets executed.

```python
syscall = b.get_syscall_fnname("execve")
```

`get_syscall_fnname` is a `BCC` utility function to get the name of the
function associated with the given system call. In our case, we are using `execve`
system call which is called whenever a new program starts executing.

We are using the utility function instead of hard-coding the function name because
the `execve` is a standard interface in linux kernel, but the implementing function
name differs on the basis of the chip architecture. Our utility function does all
the heavy lifting for us to find the function name.

```python
b.attach_kprobe(event=syscall, fn_name="hello")
```

`attach_kprobe` utility function loads the program into the kernel and attaches it
to the provided event. In our case, function named `hello` is attached to the system
call `execve`.

```python
b.trace_print()
```

`trace_print()` is a `BCC` utility function that reads indefinitely (until program
execution is stopped with `ctrl+c`) from the pseudofile `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe`.

## The output

## Summary

We have a python program that compiles and loads the eBPF program into the kernel
and attaches it to the `execve` system call. The eBPF program then writes ‚ÄúHello
World‚Äù to a fixed file `/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_pipe` every time `execve`
system call gets triggered. Finally our Python program reads whatever is written
into that file and prints it on the terminal.

## What next

In the upcoming articles, we will build on top of the concepts we learnt here
and check other ways of writing eBPF programs, we will start moving away from
`BCC`'s utility functions and handle everything on our own to better understand
what is happening under the hood.

We will also look into other more efficient ways of sharing information between
user and kernel space and we will learn how to efficiently run eBPF programs. So
yes, a lot of amazing topics are yet to be discussed üöÄ
