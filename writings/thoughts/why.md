The initial thought of writing this article was again defining "What I want",
but turns out, I needed to understand "Why I want it" more than anything.

Staying at my Home, staying at my place is keeping me away from so many
experiences. Magic happens with randomness, My entire life is not just
about knowing what I want and getting it. I want to experience things I did not
know existed, new Experiences.

There are amazing people in the world, I feel a certain kind of way when
I talk to people who understand, it makes me feel, complete.

There are beautiful views to see, mountains, rivers, valleys, forests and
so on, the world is filled with beauty. Nature gives me peace. I like to
just sit alone, in the perfect temperature, watching nature just exist.

There are tasty things to eat, humans have progressed so much in terms of
cuisine, as a fellow human, what is the point of being alive if I can't
taste it all before dying?

Writing more.
