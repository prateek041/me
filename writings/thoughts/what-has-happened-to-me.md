What has happened to me? Writing this while listening to "Without You"
by Karan Aujla. Actually, press the "Play" button above, maybe you can
be in the same head-space as I was while writing it. Wait a few seconds
since the song might be loading.

Ok.

It has been for a while, I feel like I am not the same person anymore.
Something is missing, maybe it's the drive, or just the will to go too far
for everything. Have the failures won? Have I given up from the inside?
I am not really sure at this point, but something feels off. Who am I feeling?
This has nothing to do with work. Here is the thing.

There is this girl, I used to think I will never fall for her, but I eventually
did. I love her now. Slight discomfort from her side, something like her not
responding to my texts feels like my world has ended.

We used to talk, a lot. Late in the night, till 3, 4. Yesterday, for the first
time we did not. I waited till 2, thinking or maybe hoping that she will text.
It's not that I wait for her to text, for our conversation to start. It's that
I have mentioned it multiple times and made it clear that I am willing to talk
to her anytime, It is she, who has to find time for me. Turns out, she didn't
find it this time.

Many things are happening at the same time, I don't know if this is me who is
thinking too much, or the thing is actually testing me. I have expressed how
I feel, she has too, but I said that I love her, and she has said that she
likes me. She has had a tragic past, people lied to her, cheated on her.
Usually, I am sensible enough to walk from situations like these, I know better,
this is bad for me, but I cannot walk away from her, I have lost all my senses.

I talk about marrying her, which is a really big deal for me. If I am saying this
to a girl, that means I have already thought about all the scenarios, and I am
happy with all of it. I think she doesn't know the depth of it. And obviously,
why would she? How can she understand what I feel, she is not me. What a situation.

I always knew that chances of her falling for me are not that high, but for it
to ever happen, we need to meet in person regularly. But her parents are strict,
they ask her all the time why is she leaving the home, and she has come out with
me on many occasions, but by lying that she is going to meet some of her female
friend. And that's why we haven't met in like a week. Last time we met, we went
out on a movie, then a cafe and we walked on the street while holding hands.

The thing that is bothering me is, should I pretend? I can be thinking about
"What she wants to hear", or "What she wants me to do" and do exactly that I
think I can keep her interest that way, but should I do it? Or should I even do
it? For the first time I think, I am courageous enough to take the risk of her
walking away if she doesn't find the real me interesting. I don't want to manipulate
this one. And if that is what it takes, I think I am willing to loose it all.

Actually, I am a strong believer "If it has to happen, it will". And have been
applying this to every aspect of my life. With that principle, I think if she
was interested in me, she would have do everything that she could to be with me.
But again, I am not applying this principle to this aspect of my life. For the
first time I am thinking, "Her parents are strict", "Every person's up-bringing
is not the same, not everyone fights for what they think they want". But there
is a big assumption here, Does she want me?

Why am I breaking all the signs, and safety mechanisms that I have had in place?
They are there to protect me only after all? What has happened to me? Am I willing
to get hurt after so long? Isn't that what loving someone is all about? Accepting
the possibility that they can hurt me and still doing it, because the slight
possibility of everything working out outweighs practically everything?

Maybe I am being too stupid, maybe this is clingy, and I will fuck everything up
because of this. Maybe I am asking too much of her, too much from her. And this
asking is maybe not justified and will be the end of us. Maybe I am thinking too
much, maybe I am ignoring the signs, maybe I just feel too much. Maybe.

What has happened to me?
