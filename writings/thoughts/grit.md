Life can be weird right?

This entire month I have been quite stressed and when I think about it, there are
good reasons for it. I got a chance to work at a fairly better company, which
would allow me to do great work, with great people, but I am not sure if I will
get to join them. Then, my sister has her Job interview coming up really soon,
but she is not ready for it.

I feel isolated, most of the people in my friend group are doing something, not
something I would love to do, or enjoy, but it feels like they are living their
life, meanwhile I am putting everything aside, for a dream, which has no
guarantee to come true.
