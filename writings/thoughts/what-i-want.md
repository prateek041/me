I have been thinking about it for sometime, I believe everyone does. There is nothing worst than not knowing what you want from your life. I'll tell you what I want.

Let's start with the basics:

- I want to live my life on my own terms, In my 22 years of life I have realised that I cannot listen to others telling me what to do, specifically if they are dumb. (what is dumb for me? Later on)
- I want to have enough financial prowess to not think about it, travelling every 2 months to a new place? Yes! Eating from whatever restaurant I want? Yes! Ordering ice-cream at 3 PM in the night? YES! See the list goes on, I will summarise it in the end, just letting my thoughts flow.
- Health, I want to be Jacked as Fuck, 85-90 Kilograms with 15-20% body fat is the goal. Cardiovascular health good enough, averaging 130 **bpm** while high intensity training.
