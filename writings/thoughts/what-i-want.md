There is a lot to think about really, so many things cross my mind on a regular
basis. I did think about it recently, I gave it an entire day. I think I came
up with one simple want in my life.

**Freedom**. Freedom from being constrained of my own time and finances. I don't
want to apply for a leave, before I can spend time with my loved ones. I also don't
want to miss an opportunity of being with my loved ones just because I don't have
the financial means for solving the money problem. Distance is a money problem,
health is one too.

The more I think about it, I realise how hard it actually is. I think this is
the hardest thing to achieve in life. Every living thing on this planet, wants
you to obey and do their bidding. Whether it is a job, or even a relationship.
Submitting to someone isn't bad inherently, but submitting to someone you don't
want to? I cannot do that.

I would obey what the love of my life says, but not my Boss. I hate the concept
of a boss, and the world has normalised it. I have met exactly 0 Bosses in my life
who actually cared about their employee. They just do it to a certain extent. The
power dynamics is insane. If they had to choose between you going out on a date
vs them going out, they will make you stay a 100% of the times.

Similar to time freedom, I have lost a lot to **Financial Freedom**. Meeting that
friend, going on that trip to see a mountain range, gifting something to my sister.
Taking away all the fears of someone's life. I wanted to do all of these at a
certain point, but I just could not. I want to be spontaneous in my life, and
it comes at a cost.

One more thing I have been thinking about is my internal freedom. Freedom from
being angry, anxious, unhappy with my own self. I want the ability to forgive
myself for my mistakes. But this is a life-long nut to crack and I have no idea
how to get there.

This article is not about how will I get it, this is about me clearly defining what
I want in my life. And I have clearly done that.
