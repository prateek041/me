I reached there, life felt different, people were different. I did not
feel alone or left out, everything was just calm. I don't know how I felt because
I was not thinking about myself anymore, I was just excited. It was
different. There were less people on the streets, buildings looked empty, it felt
like I was in a ghost town. A Ghost town in which I could stop, and think.

Architecture of the buildings was different, so many windows, they felt empty
but, they were not. People were just at home, busy in their own lives. It took
me around 30-40 minutes to reach my Hotel, it was an AirBnB, a Penthouse.

When the cab stopped, I couldn't find our building. They all looked so similar,
I was not familiar with the addressing scheme there. While writing this article,
I just googled that place again, it felt like I was back there. "Nestroyplatz".

The "emptiness" was enhanced because of the weather. It was raining, wind was
strong as well. There were not a lot of people on the streets, actually no one.
Even at 11 AM in the morning. We went to the closest restaurant, asked them if
they knew this "street" we had our building in. They did not know.

I just left my bags in a place, and started walking. It was cold, very cold. I
walked around many such streets, trying to understand the numbers written on the
buildings. After almost 10 minutes, I found the building. Turns out, it was 7-8
steps away from where my cab dropped me.

We reached our room, the neighbouring rooms were empty, or so I thought. It was
so silent, all I could hear was the sound of cars moving on the streets. The place
was beautiful, minimal. Light Oak Mykonos flooring, white walls, Silence. This
was the first time I saw skylight in-person. One in the bathroom, another in the
bedroom.I went to take a shower, change of clothes, Finally it was time to eat
something.

I went to an Indian restaurant closes to me, with a good rating. If it was India,
I would have ordered some food online, directly to my place, but turns out it was
not as common in Vienna, good right? I had to leave the comfort of my place. The
place I went to was almost 2 KMs away, I walked.

The streets were completely empty, just 1 or 2 people once in a while and cars.
Cars that respected the pedestrians, they would wait for you, let you cross the
street. I know it sounds like a small thing, for me, it was not. In almost 20
minutes I reached the cafe, ate some Biriyani. The chef was the owner, he welcomed
us nicely, he felt, calm. After sometime, I was back at my place.

Some of the people I'm very fond of right now, were a complete stranger to me,
Harsh, Animesh, Hrithik to name a few. One of the best decision I made in the
entire trip was to share the place with these strangers. I'm glad that I did
not stay alone. The moment they reached, we went out to roam the streets
aimlessly.

We walked, for hours, stopped, ate, and walked again. We all had the Vienna pass,
so we were randomly cathing trams, busses with the thought, "this one might take
us to a nice place". Not silence, but peace. Finally the day ended with us reaching
our place around 11 in the night. It was around 2:30 in the night in India, my
family had already slept, I couldn't talk to them. Next morning I had a talk at
Open Source Summit Europe, so prepped for it.

Writing more.
