We are born, life starts. We all start at a different point in time, place, social status, environment, but life starts. Did we have a choice in it? not really, but luckily no one does.

The moment life starts, we as humans start experiencing things. Some of those things make us happy, some sad. I don't personally consider "angry" as a life experience so leaving that out. I feel like every experience teaches us something and a lot of people agree with me on that, but there is more.

Every experience is like a **weight** that gets added onto our shoulders, these are the weights we use to **Balance** our thought process, these weights help us make decisions. Sometimes these weights become burdens.

Today I realised I hurt yet another person. They are from a different world, they have different weights in their life. They were living their lives with their own problems, but we met and I added more to their weights. I did not want to, but I did.

Why to even connect with people? All we do is share our burdens, why should the other person have to deal with my burdens? It was not their fault that I am the way I am, they are innocent, they see good in people, they have their innocent expectations, why they have to be sad because of other's burdens?

In this world, the best thing that can happen is not knowing much about the world. **Ignorance** is bliss, born in a normal family, with normal family members, parents alive to see your children, dying with time, normal Job, normal love life.

No one deserves my burdens.
