## Fountane (Work Summary)

At Fountane, I contributed as a **Full Stack Engineer**, handling various
aspects of **frontend**, **backend**, and **DevOps** development.
On the **frontend**, I worked extensively with **Next.js**, **React**, and
**Tailwind CSS**, building dynamic user interfaces and improving user experiences.
I also gained experience with **Hasura** and **GraphQL**, which I leveraged to
design efficient APIs and streamline data fetching.

For the **backend**, I implemented **JWT-based authentication** and designed
robust APIs using **Go** and the **Gin framework**, focusing on scalability and
performance. I built efficient image upload systems, managed databases using
**Bun ORM**, and wrote comprehensive tests to ensure reliability. I also
spearheaded **CI/CD pipelines** using **Kubernetes**, reducing deployment
times and improving workflow efficiency.

Additionally, I developed the **Fountane landing page** independently,
showcasing my ability to deliver complete solutions. I actively explored
**Cloud Native technologies**, contributing to **Kubernetes** and expanding
my knowledge in the DevOps domain.

My time at Fountane was marked by impactful projects and significant growth,
both technically and professionally.

## LFX Mentorship

For the next three months, I got mentored one-on-one by a senior mentor at
a leading cloud native company [Isovalent](https://isovalent.com). My
learnings exploded exponentially. A developed an entire **Kubernetes Operator**
using Go. I also learnt about writing **Integration** and **unit tests**.
The technologies I learnt and implemented were, **Helm**, **Kuberntes Go
Client**, **Kube Builder**, **GitHub Actions** and most important, How to
work with an International organisation, I got the code reviews I was looking for.

These are the Pull requests I worked on:

- [Custom resource definition and Helm chart](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/pull/1351)
- [Registration logic for Custom Resource](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/pull/1369)
- [Kubernetes Controller](https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/pull/1410)

## Fountane (Internship)

During my internship at Fountane, I learned a great deal from my mentor
[Siddharth Gelera](https://reaper.is). This was my first experience of being
paid for writing code, and I contributed to various **Front-End tasks**.
I also learned **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Hasura**, which
introduced me to **GraphQL**. I was captivated by how GraphQL solved many
challenges, so I explored it deeply, building several projects, including
[Top Crew](https://github.com/prateek041/Top-crew), where I gained expertise.
It was also where I learned and implemented **Authentication** and **Authorization**.

While interning, I continued my journey with **Go** and **Kubernetes**, seeking
opportunities to contribute to **Cloud Native projects**.

## DevOps

I began my DevOps journey with
[90 Days of DevOps](https://github.com/prateek041/DevOps-90days),
revisiting foundational topics like **Operating Systems** and **Computer Networking**
while learning new concepts such as **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**,
**Azure Cloud**, and **Git/GitHub**.

After months of learning, I discovered a strong interest in **Kubernetes Development**
and started exploring ways to contribute to the project, which led me to learn
the **Go Programming Language**.

Meanwhile, my public profile and "learn in public" approach caught the attention
of [Fountane](https://fountane.com), who offered me a six-month internship as a
**Full Stack SDE Intern**.

## Open Source

I wanted to be part of a community that welcomed beginners while offering
opportunities to learn from senior engineers. Exploring the GSoC website
led me to **CNCF**, an active and massive community centered around
**Kubernetes**, the second-largest OSS project. The scale and activity intrigued
me, and I decided to get involved.

However, the ecosystem's complexity, especially around Kubernetes, was a
blocker. While I grasped some aspects from web-based projects, the **Kubernetes
Readme** was overwhelming at first. With the communityâ€™s guidance, I learned
what to focus on and began exploring foundational concepts. This journey
ultimately introduced me to **DevOps**.

## Web Development

### Front-end

I started with **Front-End Development**, leveraging my design experience and
initial coding knowledge from school. Learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and
**JavaScript** felt natural, and I built several projects to refine my skills.
I chose **React** as my primary library for its flexibility in building dynamic
projects. To address challenges with **state management**, I learned **Redux**
and implemented it in various projects, many of which utilized APIs.
This sparked my curiosity about how APIs function.

### Back-end

To understand how APIs work, I transitioned to **Back-End Development**,
learning **Node.js** and building projects focused on **REST APIs**.
I explored **MongoDB** as a database for its versatility. Discovering
the potential of **Full Stack Engineering**, I embraced it wholeheartedly,
motivated by the opportunities it presented. My growing interest in
collaboration and learning from experienced developers led me toward
**Open-Source Development**.

## Computer Science

I am from an Engineering Background, with major in Computer Science so I had an environment,
that made me try programming. Following the curriculum, I learnt the **C** Programming
language, along with **Data Structures and Algorithms** using C.

Then other subjects I enjoyed are **Operating Systems**. I got familiar with the
**Linux** Operating System. Really dived deep into it, tinkered with the system
calls using C programming language. I thoroughly read this book
[Operating System Concepts](https://www.amazon.in/Operating-System-Concepts-International-Student/dp/8126520515/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=14D4OA1ULJJQJ&keywords=operating+system+concepts&qid=1696230952&sprefix=operating+system+concep%2Caps%2C337&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1)
for about 2 months.

Another subject I really enjoyed was **Computer Networking**. Playing around with
packet tracer really made me understand how the internet works. This book
specifically,
[Computer Networks: A Top Down Approach](https://www.amazon.in/Computer-Networking-Top-DownApproach-Kurose-69696966/dp/B0C6TW7Q7T/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3UA8MOLQ41Q9X&keywords=kurose&qid=1696230499&sprefix=kurose%2Caps%2C278&sr=8-3)
was a great learning experience. I spent like 2-3 months on this.

Other subjects I enjoyed learning and dived deep are **Theory of Automata**,
**Compiler Design** and **Design and Analysis of Algorithms**. Also, I was exploring
outside my Computer Science Curriculum in the meanwhile, below is the list of them.

## Design

Initial interests being design and art where I learned about design principles for
some time, I liked Typography, layout design, Poster designs etc. I am self taught
in most of the things, It can be a boon as well as a curse. The biggest problem
with being a beginner in any domain, is wrong advice. I liked design, but did not
know how to capitalise that skill and a lot of people around me gate-keeped saying
, I cannot be a good designer if I have not been to a design school. I did not stay
with it long enough which I personally think was a good decision.

The skills did not go to waste though (they never do), I designed many websites/
posters for my college events. People really liked the designs. I often helped
my peer learn the skills too. Learning Design basics actually helped me a lot for
the next step as well. Which was Web Development.
